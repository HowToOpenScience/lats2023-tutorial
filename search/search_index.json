First, we will provide a presentation on an overview of a few problems when conducting research. Using this as a baseline, we will introduce open science and its practices and how they can be used to nullify some of these issues and mitigate others. In addition, we will attempt to dispel some of the misconceptions of these practices. Second, we will provide a live example of using the Open Science Framework (OSF) website to make an account, create a project, add contributors, add content and licensing, and publicize the project for all to see. Afterwards, we will provide a guide to creating a preregistration, explaining best practices, and identifying how to create an embargo. Additional features and concerns, such as anonymizing projects for review and steps required to properly do so, will be shown. Third, we will discuss reproducibility metrics within work when providing datasets and materials. This will review commonly used software and languages (e.g., Python , R and RStudio , Visual Studio Code ) and how, without any steps taken, most work tends to be extremely tedious to reproduce or are not reproducible in general. Afterwards, we will provide some mitigation strategies needed to remove these concerns. Finally, we will use a few papers, each containing different issues, and apply the necessary steps needed to reproduce the results within the paper.","title":"Agenda"},{"location":"agenda/#agenda","text":"The times provided are approximated for the maximum amount of time spent on each section.

This term gained popularity in the early 2010s when researchers noticed that they were unable to replicate or reproduce prior work done within a discipline 3 . There was also a large amount of ambiguity when trying to understand what processes were used in a study. Open science, as a result, started to gain more traction to provide greater context, robustness, and reproducibility metrics. From there, many disciplines of research created their own formal definition and recommended practices. The widespread adoption of open science increased exponentially when large scale studies conducted in the mid 2010s found that numerous works were difficult or impossible to reproduce and replicate in psychology 4 and other disciplines 5 . There are numerous processes that open science can be broken down into such as open data, open materials, open methodology, and preregistration. Open Data specifically targets datasets and their documentation for public use without restriction, typically under a permissive license or in the public domain 6 . Not all data can be openly released (such as with personally identifiable information); but there are specifications for protected access that allow anonymized datasets to be released or a method to obtain the raw dataset itself. Open Materials is similar in regard except it concerns tools, source code, and their documentation 7 . This tends to be synonymous with Open Source in the context of software development, but materials are used to encompass the source in addition to available, free-to-use technologies. Open Methodology defines the full workflow and processes used to conduct the research, including how the participants were recruited and the procedure they went through 1 . The methodologies typically expand upon the original paper, such as technicalities that would not fit in the paper format, or survey items or test questions administered to participants. Finally, Preregistration acts as a time-stamped copy of the initial methodology and analysis plan before the start of a study, defining the process of research without knowledge of the outcomes 8 9 . Preregistrations can additionally be updated to preserve the initial experiment conducted and the development as more context is generated and changes must be made (but all changes are documented). Open science practices and reproducibility metrics are becoming more commonplace within numerous scientific disciplines. Within subfields of educational technology, however, the adoption and review of these practices and metrics are neglected or sparsely considered 10 . There are some subfields of education technology that have taken the initiative to introduce open science practices (special education 11 ; gamification 12 , education research 13 ); however, other subfields have seen little to no adoption. Concerns and inexperience in what can be made publicly available to how to reproduce another\u2019s work are some of the few reasons why education researchers may choose to avoid or postpone discussion on open science and reproducibility. On the other hand, lack of discussion can lead to tediousness and repetitive communication for datasets and materials or cause a reproducibility crisis 5 within the field of study. As such, there is a need for accessible resources and understanding on open science, how it can be used, and how to mitigate any potential issues that may arise within one\u2019s work at a later date.

You can find all the tools and links here in addition to their License and Terms of Use ( ToU ) / Service ( ToS ). ORCID iD An ORCID iD is a universally unique digital identifier for a researcher. While ORCID iDs are not the focus of this tutorial, it is still highly recommended for you as a researcher to have one such that all papers you have written can be linked back to you. ORCID iDs are provided under the following Terms of Use . Open Science Framework The Open Science Framework, commonly known as OSF , is a project manager which allows researchers to provide, document, archive, collaborate, share, and register methodologies, materials, data, and outcomes. We will provide a live example on how to create and navigate an OSF project, so it is highly recommended to have one so you can follow along. OSF accounts can be created from an ORCID iD . The Open Science Framework is provided under the Terms of Use provided by the Center for Open Science, Inc. AsPredicted AsPredicted is an alternative to OSF registrations where a research can create a preregistration for their given project. While this tutorial will focus on using OSF for registrations, many researchers use AsPredicted to host their preregistrations, so it is worthwhile to be aware of and understand it. AsPredicted is provided under the following Terms of Use . Git Git is a version control system for project management. Git projects stored on a remote git host (e.g. GitHub ( ToS ), GitLab ( ToU ), etc.) can be integrated into an OSF project for proper version control. Almost all public materials that use a codebase are hosted within a git repository, so you will need to be aware of some basic commands to clone existing repositories and create your own. Git is licensed under the GPL-2.0 License . Git Clients If you would like to use a GUI Client instead of inputting the commands through the terminal, a Git Client can be used instead. In addition to the built-in tools, there a number of third-party tools. Make sure to adhere to the Licenses and ToU / ToS provided. Visual Studio Code ( VSCode ) Visual Studio Code is a rich text editor created by Microsoft commonly used for programming and integration. Users can build extensions for better support of a particular file. There are other rich text editors or IDEs used by other researcher; however, this tutorial will be centered around using VSCode . VSCode is available under a Microsoft Software License ; however, it can be built manually under the MIT License . Docker Docker is a combination of open source projects used to create and manage applications. One of the core features of Docker is the development and distribution of containers: a snapshot of the current working environment, such as an OS . These are particularly useful to ship alongside existing materials such that the user is able to use your environment for reproducibility or replicability of the available research. We will be using Docker to create and distribute containers for the existing papers, so it is highly recommended to download and set up. Docker is provided under the following Terms of Service with its consumed projects under the Apache-2.0 License and others. Python Python is a programming language generally used to produce relatively efficient proof-of-concept code. Researchers typically use Python since it is relatively simple to understand / use and has a large number of packages / modules that can be consumed. It is highly likely one of the projects on the agenda will be written in Python 3, so it is recommended to have or setup through a Docker container. Python 3 is licensed under the PSF License Agreement . R R is a programming language used for statistical computation and graphic representations. Researchers who require more complex mathematics typically use R as the language and packages are written by other mathematicians. It is highly likely one of the projects on the agenda will be written in a version of R, so it is recommended to have or setup through a Docker container. R is licensed under GPL-2.0 License . RStudio RStudio is an IDE created by Posit for programming with R. It is one of the most commonly used IDEs by researchers for R development. While this tutorial will focus more on VSCode , if an R project is used, we will review the subsequent steps for setup in RStudio due to its popularity. RStudio is licensed under AGPL-3.0 License . ECMAScript JavaScript is a programming language typically used for scripting in web applications. A good portion of user-facing web applications use JavaScript or one of its many consumers to provide client-side logic and interactions. Researchers will typically use ECMAScript , a JavaScript standard, in web applications, so it is highly recommended to have a basic understanding of how the language functions. ECMASCript is provided under the ECMA Copyright Notice and software is licensed under the BSD-3-Clause License . Node.js Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on top of Google's V8 engine . Node.js is commonly used by researchers for web applications due to its commonality, integration, and numerous packages written. While you don't need to know any specifics here, it is still a useful material to read up on if you have the time. Node.js is licensed under the MIT License with included external libraries under a variety of licenses. npm npm is a package manager for Node.js. Most applications created by researchers are most likely built with npm since it tends to have easy runtime support and standardized access to published packages. It is highly recommended to review this topic in case you would like to build a front-end web application yourself. npm is licensed under the Artistic-2.0 License with its public registry under the following Terms of Use nvm nvm is a version manager for Node.js and npm. This is particularly useful if you need to use someone else's environment or make your own more robust. All nvm implementations recommended by npm are licensed under the MIT License .","title":"Supplemental Materials"},{"location":"supplemental/#supplemental-materials","text":"We want to provide you with all the resources we may use during our tutorial.
